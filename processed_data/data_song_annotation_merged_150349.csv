These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.""|Neither of them is a living creature, yet both were cast alive into the lake of fire.

Many claim that the lake of fire is some kind of eternal hell where the unsaved people will suffer for eternity. But on the other hand, one needs to bear in mind that the Book of Revelation is full of symbols.

I think this line is in a way about how caring about other people can actually create a division between you and they when that empathy is one-sided. Empathy is actually a rather rare trait in people, and can actually make a person feel isolated as much as connected.', 'This builds on the notion of feeling separated from other people in a categorical sense (other people wont accept me/dont understand me/Im not like them, ect.). It may be self-referencing and alluding to Mikes battle rap career (fights for fun), but I think it definitely has a purpose to express the notion of acting to push someone to extremes because its the only time they show who they really are when you cant find another way to make that reality of them as a person accessible to you when they constantly veil themselves behind something else.', 'This line really makes it seem possible that Mike is mostly talking about himself. He won acclaim and great reputation but this might be a claim that it didnt create satisfaction for him. He has fans and admirers but it doesnt make him feel any better, or as though he has done the right thing or accomplished something. He still feels sorry for himself, even more-so for the superficial reasons people might find to say he is a big success. The more success he has as an artist, the greater the dissonance between that success and his own dissatisfaction.']",3

Some think the Joker is a symbol for Jesus, since he interacts with a thief, and Jesus was crucified next to the Penitent thief and Impenitent thief. Additionally, some believe that the Joker is Dylan himself, and the thief is Elvis Presley, as Elvis was accused of stealing rock and roll from the African-Americans to make money. Some have gone even deeper and view the joker and the thief as symbols of life and death. A lot of this song has to do with perspective; the businessmen see things differently than the joker, the princes see things differently than the servants, the thief sees things differently than the plowmen. A concise and beautifully written song like this lends itself to so many different meanings that no interpretation can be proven incorrect. So view it however you like; all we can do is give more information to help you form an opinion.|What we do know about the thief and the Joker is that they are outsiders in some capacity. They operate outside the walls of conventional psychological safety, and would rather spend their time risking the threats of wolves and howling winds than be cooped up behind the safe walls the princes hide behind. The Joker expresses frustration and some degree of sadness at the state of the world, and shows a desire to change things.|http://screencast.com/t/JNtwdvjtzDFQ', 'No matter where the setting is, its clear that it is a place full of turmoil. To the few that arent willing to go along with it, that would be very unsettling. The joker is starting to get really uncomfortable.|Possible reference to U.S. involvement in Vietnam, as no one was really sure what the goal of the war was, and there was no way of winning it and getting relief. This song came out in 1968, and the late 1960s is when people started to realize that there was no end in sight.', 'Now we start to see more specifically why the joker is upset with the way things are. The way he says this makes you think he is sick of people commodifying and taking whatever they can for personal gain. He views the world as his earth because he is one of the few that doesnt view the earth as a source of money and personal growth.', 'This sets up the scenery a little bit. Them along the line most likely refers to a group of watchtowers set up outside whatever city the duo is in right now. The joker criticizes these people in the watchtowers for not realizing the real worth of things. All they care about is making money (the businessmen) and drinking wine.', 'The thief is the voice of reason here. He tries to calm down the panicking joker. The fact that the thief is the kind and reasonable one reaffirms the idea that this song has a lot to do with perspectives; the world views all thieves as the lowest of the low, even though not all thieves are the same.', 'So far the joker and thief seem to be a lonely duo. Theyre viewed as the outcasts of their town, so it seems strange that the thief would talk about people among us. Maybe he is just referring to the other people in wherever theyre located, the businessman, plowmen, and people in watchtowers. No one in this place appreciates the beauty of life. The thief and joker are very skeptical about how good life really is, and the rest just view it as a joke. No one knows what any of it is worth.|Mythologically perhaps the Joker is Loki|After Loki had been chased away by Thor for insulting all the gods and goddesses, Loki was then sought out and chained to a rock by the entrails of his son Narvi, who had been torn to pieces by his son, Vali, who had been transformed into a ravenous wolf. The faithful Sigyn kept watch over her husband, catching the poison from the serpent that Skadi placed over Lokis head. It was said that, when Sigyn left to empty the bowl, the poison would drip into Lokis eyes. His writhing from the pain caused earthquakes.|And the Thief is Prometheus A trickster figure who is credited with the creation of man from clay, and who defies the gods and gives fire to humanity, an act that enabled progress and civilization. Prometheus is known for his intelligence and as a champion of mankind.|They are two trickster characters both bound from their actions.', 'At one point it seems that the joker and thief thought the same way as the others; that life is a joke. But something changed, and now they see things the way they really are.', 'By using fate here, the thief gives an ominous feeling about what will happen to the people that dont change their way of thinking. It seems like they will be forced to change.|Also, it shows that the joker and thief have shared experiences leading into this conversation. We know they have been through that, and now the thief is confident enough to predict he and the jokers fate.', 'The closest translation of this line I can get is, the thief is telling the joker not to worry or complain about how the world/city is messed up, they already know this. No need to keep complaining about it, lets do something.', 'The reason the thief wants them to end this conversation is that it is getting late, and something is about to happen. This has a Biblical feel to it (judgement day, anyone?) as well see later. Mainly though, the thief needs this conversation to end so they can do something more important.', 'The whole scenery switches as we go into this verse. We go from the outskirts of town, to right up on the edges of it where the watchtowers are.|This verse seems to be somewhat similar in language to a passage in the Bible; Isaiah Chapter 21, verses 5-9, where it reads|""Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise ye princes, and prepare the shield. For thus hath the Lord said unto me, go set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth. And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with such heedAnd, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground""|The watchtowers here could be viewed in the Biblical sense, as the towers set up outside of Babylon to protect from intruders.|Or, as this song was released around the time of the Vietnam War, the watchtowers could be a reference to the actual watchtowers France set up all around Vietnam when they conquered parts of it. If you look at it this way, the conflict that the thief and joker have talked about have to due with the turmoil in America during war time, when the country wasnt sure what to do.', 'The thing to note here is the differing classes in or around the watchtower. You have the privileged princes completely safe up in their watchtowers, the women passing around the area. Even the lowly slaves are coming. This represents how when this change comes it will be all the way from the top to bottom. Everyone will be in for a shock when they realize life is more than a joke.', 'Now we switch to a little farther away from the watchtower. The folks in the watchtower seem to be sensing that something is coming, they are keeping the view and waiting to see something. But they dont see an army or anything of the sort. They are getting indications from nature itself that the world is about to change.|This could also be a biblical reference to the coming of the Lion of Judah.', 'Are the joker and thief witnessing these riders from the watchtower  or are they the riders themselves?|If its the second, now we find out what the thief was so anxious about. Instead of talking falsely, these two have decided to do something, and ride into the city. It is not exactly clear what theyre doing, but it creates a state of chaos.|This line does suggest the four horsemen who brought news of the Apocalypse in the Bible. It seems like the news theyre bringing is really going to shake things up, but naturally the song comes to an end before it is revealed what they have to say.|The winds here are probably a symbol of the winds of change, and go along with the nature theme of the last few verses.']",14

It describes a pretty depressing scene, and sets up the transition into the uplifting chorus.', 'The first way to take this line is that the narrator is literally describing the end of the world. This song came out the same year as December 21, 2012, where a lot of people were predicting the end of the world. And shortly after that came the North Korean nuclear threats. Both these events give some credibility to the idea that this line means exactly what it sounds like: the end of the civilized world.|But it seems more like the depressing landscape isnt a prediction of what is going to happen  it is a description of what is going on right now. Sure, it isnt like the whole world is literally a wasteland, but there are countless political and economic issues destroying the world we live in.|The whole waking up idea might have something to do with the rebirth of a phoenix. When a phoenix dies, it bursts into flames then is immediately reborn in the ashes. So the narrator could be comparing this awakening he has experienced to the rebirth of a phoenix.|Comments from the writer of the song Dan Reynolds steer the meaning away from an actual post-apocalyptic world, but the song can mean to you whatever you want.|""A lot of people probably see a post-apocalyptic world when they hear Radioactive, understandably, but we wanted to deliver something that was maybe a little different from that  a lot different from that.""', 'Sweat my rust is the interesting part here. Rust is iron oxide, formed when iron is exposed to air.|Obviously humans wouldnt sweat rust, so it seems like Dan could be using a metaphor to imply that humans are so controlled and programmed these days that its almost like they are just robots. Alternatively, he could be in shock after the apocalypse and unable to emotionally process what is happening  robots also lack emotion.', 'This is about nuclear pollution in the aftermath of a conflict. Nuclear fallout contaminates the land and the air after a nuclear blast, and radioactive isotopes can hang around in the air for years.|It could also refer to smoking, either by the narrator himself or everyone around him. In the music video, it immediately shows a man smoking after this line.|After this line, Dan takes a deep breath in and out.', 'To tie it in to the previous line, it could just be a regular bus that takes the average American to their mindless job. They just commute back and forth everyday without any thought until they just do it automatically. All this makes them feel trapped, like they are actually imprisoned. This contributes to why the narrator only sees the world as a shit hole. But he wants to break away and eject from that way of thinking and make something of his life.', 'Based on what the narrator described since the first line, the normal of apocalypse doesnt seem to fit any more. It appears that he is more talking about a dramatic change in an individual or government. The apocalypse could just be that moment the narrator has been waiting for, when he realizes what is wrong with the world and decides to make a change.|Lead singer Dan Reynolds describes this himself:|""Generally speaking, its a song about having an awakening; kind of waking up one day and deciding to do something new, and see life in a fresh way""|But we see later that this song has a lot to do with revolution. So, taking it in that sense, the apocalypse would be some huge event that completely changes the social structure and world we live in. Considering this song came out pretty close to the Occupy Wall Street movement, that certainly would make sense.', 'This continues the trend of strong language to get the point across, similar to the usage of apocalypse to describe a drastic change. In this case the narrator describes his awakening with strong language to emphasize that he has finally come to a realization and is ready to change things. The narrator here is so overwhelmed by this new feeling that he cant control it.|Also, similar to the  sweat my rust  line, he seems to be comparing humans to machines, considering he calls his body his system. Because before this awakening that is exactly what he felt like.', 'This new age refers to two things. First, the new chapter in the narrators life. He has had his epiphany or awakening, whatever you want to call it, and is about to start acting completely different. And it also refers to the new world the survivors live in after this mysterious apocalypse.|In a real world sense, this is probably referring to the nuclear age. There has been a fear of full on nuclear war for a while now, and that fear escalated when North Korea made its intent to bomb the United States clear. It is a dangerous world that we live in is the main message of the line.', 'This feeling of revolution, awakening, etc. that the narrator has is very strong. He takes the strength of it literally and compares it to the exposure of radiation, and that is why he feel[s] it in his bones.|More literally, radioactivity is also one of the effects of dropping a nuclear bomb. Like most of the song, this line can be taken literally or metaphorically. Incidentally, about a month before this song came out, it was discovered that North Koreas nuclear bomb testing was causing Radioactive gases to escape in the area.|Theres also a slight double-entendre here  radioactive could be interpreted as active on the radio  Radioactive was radio-active on Billboards Top 100 for a whole 87 weeks (surpassing Jason Mrazs Im Yours, which rode the charts for 76 weeks).', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH9zG28GQEg|This song focuses a lot on the individual and his personal changes, but also gives political undertones. There appears to be an oppressive government at work here, and that contributes to why the world in the first verse is so messed up. After the apocalypse/awakening in the first verse, the narrator is now prepared to overthrow this government.|Some would argue that this story is an actual depiction of what is going on in the world we live in. The US government is borderline violating the rights of the citizens, the upper 2% control all almost all the wealth, and the rest of the nation has to struggle to keep up. This revolution fits in with the idea behind Occupy Wall Street and other protests.|The music video, while a little strange, echoes these same themes. It gets a little confusing and hard to explain at times, but the main ideas never stray far from the song. It tells a David vs. Goliath story where David wins the battle, frees the lower class, then brings the higher ups back to the bottom.', 'A lot of this verse seems to go along with the rise of communism, and other workers movements (the colour red is generally associated with left-wing politics  the Republican Party is a rare exception). The main idea that Karl Marx had when he came up with the idea of communism was that the proletariat (working class) would overthrow the bourgeois (upper class). Which is exactly what happens in the music video, and goes along with what the narrator is trying to accomplish in the song.', 'This just emphasizes how strong the emotions going through our narrator are. He is going to push on for this revolution until there is no more hope (i.e. the sun dies). And he states once again how he feels this all the way down to his bones.

855,99038.0,To Autumn,John Keats,23147.0,,,lit,lit,39.0,False,2012-11-01,"[""The poet is addressing autumn directly, in a rhetorical technique known as apostrophe,  not the punctuation mark but a rhetorical form of address.|Autumn is a foggy, misty season (especially in England) in which many flowers blossom and fruits ripen.|Note that Keats' poetry is characterised by lavish, sensuous imagery, reflected by the sound as well as the meaning of the words. Here, he uses long vowels in season, mellow, fruit  words that cant be said quickly. The sibilant ss and consonant clusters, as in mists and fruitfulness slow the pace, and the ls in 'mellow and fruitful  are soft and soothing. If read aloud the sound is lush and rich,"", 'Autumn shares a connection with the sun dimming (maturing) into the winter months. However they are old friends, scheming ways to make the seasons fruit ripen well and abundantly.|The sun is both maturing,(getting older) and maturing as an active verb: it is the force that makes the crops ripen.|Both the sun and the season are personified, as close-bosom friends. Bosom friend is now rarely used. Though today the idea is vaguely amusing, because of the modern association with the body  bosom buddy tends to be used humorously at the time it suggested true closeness. In the poem these friends are active with conspiring and load and bless.', 'The eves of a house are the underside of the roof that projects from the walls. Here they are sprawling with fruit vines.|Thatched cottages suggest a pastoral setting, characterized by shepherds, sheep, maidens, and agriculture. The pastoral as a literary genre was thought to originate in Ancient Greece, and the ode is a Greek form, so it is appropriate for this ode to include pastoral themes. Keatss other Great Odes, especially Ode on a Grecian Urn, include similar imagery.', ""The tree is so stacked with delicious apples, it is made to buckle and bend under the intense weight. Bend is a key verb here, alluding to the excessive growth and maturity that typifies the season. This is developed in subsequent lines as Keats loads his verse with a lexical field of images of excess  fill, swell, plump, o'er-brimmed.|The construction of the line is, again, typical Keats, with the slow-paced words and consonant clusters. The mossd cottage-trees, for example, is on the one hand concise, but it is difficult to say. As one student remarked, you have to wrap your tongue around that one. Exactly what Keats was no doubt intending."", 'Its all about the verbs here. The excesses of summer are captured in the lexical field of the words fill, swell and plump, which allude to the point just beyond perfection.|Worth noting is that Keats introduces these ideas of excess and spoil in the first stanza; his musing starts at the point at which death begins  just beyond the prime. With hindsight some commentators may read into this a hint that Keats was preparing for his premature death, as if hed reached ripeness as a poet before his time.', 'Allusion to the future. The season is not all excess; life is being created, and a sense of future hope. The word sweet is the key here.', 'The repetition of more continues the theme of excess and plenitude.', 'The rhyme scheme used in John Keats poem To Autumn for the first stanza is: ABABCDEDCCE. This intricate scheme may be a reflection of the complex and intricate workings of nature.', 'This is subtly sinister. In the previous line Keats paints a fairly standard picture of summer tranquillity (bees pollinating flowers). In this line however, he suggests that warm days WILL cease by stating that the bees think they will never cease.|The dramatic irony here is deliberate. Through his illness, Keats was well aware of his own mortality and thus knows that the warm days of his lifes summer are coming to an end. Dark, sad and poignant poetry, simultaneously wise and knowing', ""Summer has filled the cells of their honeycombs with sweet, sweet honey. (Actually, the bees themselves have done this, but the poem is giving seasons a lot of credit.)|Count the number of lines in this stanza. What do you have? 11. Important? You bet. The ode is an ancient form of celebratory verse designed to praise a subject, in this case the season of Autumn. Ten-line stanzas are much more common for odes (see Keatss own Ode on a Grecian Urn and Ode on Melancholy for examples), but here Keats adds a line. This deliberate tinkering with form is no accident. The extra line almost subliminally alludes to the excessive nature of Autumn that the poem describes. The poem itself is has o'er brimmed as the subject it praises. And as readers, we feel the discomfort of this in the forced, slightly awkward rhyme scheme. Keats, in a display of true poetic mastery, echoes Subject in Form.|Also, the extra line in each stanza is slightly sinister and foreboding, suggesting the onset of dark things ahead. A subtle addition, but deeply arresting in the context of a poem dealing with the expiry of life (by a poet who was aware of his own impending death).|A final point about this line. The last two words, clammy cells subverts the sweetness of what went before. Clammy sounds unpleasant, as if the poet will lead on to negatives as well as positives in his description of the season."", 'Stanza 2 kicks off with a personification of Autumn (continuing the metaphor introduced at the end of stanza 1). He is close enough to Autumn to speak to her.|Also worth noting is the question mark, drawing in the reader, and also maybe signaling unresolved tensions and fear. Keats is probably feeling both. By the time he was writing this poem Keats was suffering from tuberculosis, and the subtext of To Autumn, as in many of Keats\' late, great poems, may be the poets intimacy with oncoming death. (See soft-dying day in the third stanza.)|Then again, we need not read a biographical interpretation into the poem. In a letter to his friend J. H. Reynolds, Keats says:|""How beautiful the season is nowHow fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it. Really, without joking, chaste weatherDian skiesI never liked stubble-fields so much as nowAye better than the chilly green of the spring. Somehow, a stubble-field looks warmin the same way that some pictures look warm. This struck me so much in my Sundays walk that I composed upon it.""', ""Images of lethargy jump out at you here, with Autumn described as sitting careless. This could be quite innocuous and peaceful, but the lack of vitality also signals something morbid.|To develop the ambiguity further, one meaning of careless is without a worry, something positive, suggesting a youthful carefree attitude. The second meaning is negligent, suggesting thoughtlessness and wastefulness.|Of course, the latter prompts one to think immediately of the waste of a young life in Keats' premature death."", 'The image given by this line suggests Autumn may be a woman. One can picture long hair dancing in the breeze, an erotic idea, hair being a sexual trigger.|The alliteration of winnowing wind, with its repeated ws suggests the sound of the wind.|The use of winnowing wind here is apt; to winnow means to separate the chaff from the grain, a process which would be undertaken during autumn.', 'The lethargy of the lines above continues with the idea of Autumn being drowsd or doped up. Worth noting that poppies are the source of opiates such as opium and heroin, so the peacefulness of the scene definitely comes with a numbness akin toyes, death.|There may be echoes here of a passage in Shakespeares Othello ( III.iii ), actually about sleeplessness:|""Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday.""', 'The hook is the curled scythe used to harvest grain.|Yet we see Autumn here as a kind of languid, lazy Grim Reaper, sparing some flowers for the moment, but bound to strike soon.|This line is another slow tongue-twister, especially spares the next swath. The ss and the th are, again, difficult to say aloud, as if the words slow down the grim reapers scythe. The twined flowers make this pruning job extra difficult!', '(Jean-Franois Millet, The Gleaners, 1857, Muse d\'Orsay: Paris)|A gleaner was a peasant in a village or country, who went through the fields at harvest time to collect what was left by the farmers; leaving a corner or so of your field un-reaped for gleaners was a customary form of charity in England at the time.|The practice of gleaning itself is ancient, and features in the Bible, most prominently by Jesus and his followers:|""And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. Mark 2:23""', 'And sometimes you act like a worker carrying a burden of corn and balancing while crossing a stream.|The image of a heavily laden head summarises the lethargy that characterises this stanza. Life is becoming all too much  you can feel the weight of existence from this season pregnant with death.|The female Autumn is nonetheless able to keep control of her load. Perhaps this is significant as Keats admired women and fell in love readily.', 'Keats gives us the imagery of watching cider being made in a press. The patient look is consistent with the steady laden head. There is purpose underpinning this picture of lethargy. Autumn is important in preparing the world for winter.', 'This extra-line is tinged with something sinister. Last oozings suggests the final ebb of life, the word oozings, with its stretched out oo and sibilant z, is almost Gothic in its connotation of slow, thick, substances.|The long vowels in the repetition of hours also fits the slow pace of the preceding lines, maintaining the feeling of lethargy.', 'The previous stanza opened with one question; this has two. Keats is almost feverish with doubt here, with the emphasised Ay.|This line also utilises the *ubi sunt motif, which is Latin for Where are they? Ubi sunt* was common in medieval poetry, where it was used to reflect mortality and the transience of life, by questioning the fate of the strong and beautiful (here it is Spring).|This last stanza opens in an interrogative mood, questioning where spring has gone or maybe when will it return. Spring links to life and renewal, while the previous stanza anticipated death.|Note the rhythmic, almost energetic songs of Spring, changing the mood and pace after the lethargy that went before.', ""But, Keats being Keats, he doesnt do the obvious and simply lament the loss of Spring. He immediately finds solace in the unique beauty of Autumn in itself.|This line, with its reference to the music of Autumn is as close to optimistic as youll get in this Ode.|The dash at the end suggests a half-completed statement. Keats doesnt continue to explain what the music is, but leaves it unfinished. As always, we think of Keats' incomplete life, and the poetry or music he was never able to write."", ""Keats juxtaposes the barred clouds with 'bloom. It isnt clear why the clouds are barred, but maybe they block out the sun or possible he is describing their shape across the sky. Yet they bloom, suggesting fertility. It seems like an oxymoron, just as this poem intertwines the themes of life and death."", 'Here, Keats is capturing the fleeting ending of the day. This is the first explicit reference to death (dying) but it is couched with the word word soft in a surprisingly natural-sounding juxtaposition.|The pace is slow and soothing, as if the season  and the evening is comforting him. There is something erotic about this phrase, as if Autumn is a woman caressing a man.', 'Natures contradiction: the autumnal introduction of red at once seems to set the land on fire, to give it a vital rosy hue (the way a persons cheeks might be flushed with life), but also to signal the beginning of descent into winter.|Keats loves the ambivalence: he was the father of negative capability, in which the artist is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.|Keats couldnt know it, but his ideal of negative capability would later be embraced, and maybe perfected, by a new kind of poet.', 'Clear funeral imagery here. Theres something quaint about insignificant gnats mourning the passing of summer, but, as a Romantic, Keats takes this minor observation and explores it.|Autumn music can be heard in the sad or melodious songs of gnats, and this song is echoed by the hills present near the river bank and by the willow trees.|Keats was skilled at manipulation of words; the clever and concise wailful chior is a marvellous example.', 'The word sallows is intriguing and could be ambiguous. A sallow is a type of river shrub that grows in moist conditions, but it is also means a yellow colour with connotations of decay.|This line is another example of how descriptive John Keats is in this ode. His references to objects that relate to nature and the adjectives used to describe them grasp the readers attention and helps them form a mental image.', 'The key idea here is that things are not simply on a decline towards death. Keats is describing the moment of balance between life and death.|Note the juxtaposition of two sets of opposites; aloft and sinking, and lives and dies. This is in accord with the season, Autumn linking the opposites of summer and winter.|It also shows Keats as keen observer of nature, as the cloud of gnats rise and fall at the whim of the wind. They have no choice as to their fate  just like Keats.', ""To describe lambs as fully grown is an oxymoron, a contradiction in terms. They are sheep when full grown. But perhaps this implies Keats' desire to cling to the idea of summer, denying the lambs have matured or that his own poetry-writing has reached its finality. Or it could be positive, implying the near-completion of the season and lifes maturity.|Note also that a lamb is a symbol of innocence, something that Keats may have wanted to cling to. It could imply his instinctive need to deny his impeding death.|The word bleating is poignant, almost a call for help or an expression of fear of death."", ""In a traditional, 10-line ode, these would be the culminating lines, and they are (or at least can be read as) cheerful. Ish. Singing and whistling will always connote happiness.|But the song of the (Eurasian) Robin is often heard at dusk, the final song before it goes dark, wistful and plaintive  just like Keats' final stanza, of this his final poem. Also, the red-breast robin is a harbinger of winter.|Note the careful choice of words and concise compression of words; hedge-crickets and garden-croft. The bird-song is described onomatopoeically as whistles to match treble in the preceding line, and twitter in the next; a lexical field of song."", 'The swallows are preparing for migration south. Its the last sign that autumn is almost over and winter has almost arrived. The image has slightly ominous overtones: the swallows gather in the way that darkness gathers. The last word of the ode is skies; associated with the cosmos and heaven and even death.|This closing litany of autumn images was echoed in the 20th century by Wallace Stevens at the end of his famous poem Sunday Morning:|""Deer walk upon our mountains, and quail Whistle about us their spontaneous cries; Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness; And, in the isolation of the sky, At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make Ambiguous undulations as they sink, Downward to darkness, on extended wings.""']",30

It was from the perspective of a young girl. Non-sexualized, non-objectified. Just a young girl with real emotions and a desire to escape the depressing restrictions of real life.', 'The girls parents disagree about whether to let her go to the cinema. Her mother is protective, while her father is more relaxed. This argument draws the listener into the world of the song.|The way Bowie presents the conflict  the mother yelling, the father seeming resigned  is very dramatic and almost cinematic.|Its easy to see where the girls love of escapism comes from if theres conflict at home.', 'She gets to the movie theater, but cant find her friend. With a tension laced household and a careless friend that stood her up, the girls personal life is clearly revealed as a lonely dejected one.|This characterizes her appropriately and provides an understanding as to why someone like her would withdraw into a land of fantasy over reality. The struggle between these two concepts becomes the second thematic core of the song.', 'Her sunken dream is the disappointment the girl feels with the reality of life. A defeated expectation thats sunk like a boat at the bottom of the ocean.|The fact that she is able to get a good seat could imply that the movie theater is mostly vacant serving only to emphasize her overwhelming loneliness. On the other hand, it could suggest that the cinema is crowded and she has to struggle to see the screen from a seat of transfixed people.', 'Literally, the screen is the movie theaters screen, but could also broadly apply to any form of media, television or otherwise. The girl is immediately allured to this screen and sucked into its spectacle because whats captivating her is the escapism.|Escapism in art has always been subject to debate. While some could argue that arts function is to entertain and distract audiences from the concerns of the real world, others argue that it is the responsibility of art to reflect those very same concerns.|Ideally, we could achieve a balance between these two trains of thought. Just as Neil Gaiman once said,|""People talk about escapism as if its a bad thing Once youve escaped, once you come back, the world is not the same as when you left it. You come back to it with skills, weapons, knowledge you didnt have before. Then you are better equipped to deal with your current reality.""|Whether Bowies protagonist is able to recognizes this is left open ended and falls to the listener to consider but by the end, it seems Bowie is making the argument that pure escapism is not possible. That we have to face our anxieties through art.', 'In one interview, Bowie mentions how hes attracted to the same subject matter over and over but how his approach is always different.|""Bowie: [Its] like finding a different door each time I approach that subject. Interviewer: Alienation? Bowie: A lot of it is. Ones interior kind of isolation as well. It doesnt just mean ones social isolation it can mean, you know, how you get in contact with your own feelings as well.""|This idea of isolation is recurring in Bowies music. ( The Man Who Sold The World and You Feel So Lonely You Could Die.)|Here, the protagonist is an isolated young girl who regularly retreats from the disappointment of the real world and into the fantasy of film. But film too, ultimately lets her down. She comes in expecting only escapismbut since art can inevitably become a reflection of the world we live in, she finds she cant escape the realities of the world, even when theyre fabricated realities put on celluloid.|Alternatively, the girl is disappointed in film because its boringly predictable and too similar to many films shes seen before. She is annoyed with the makers of the films who expect her to still be interested in it. For her, this might be one of the worst things that could happen, the films of yesterdays excitement have become todays routine just like the rest of her life.', 'Here, we enter the point where Bowies lyrics grow so surreal, they nearly seem like lyrics drawn together through free association. However, theyre not just random, but rather, build up to what the protagonist is being shown onscreen.|Bowie paints vivid imagery starting with a sailorman brawl, going through cavemen, crooked cops, and the usual characters of cinema and setting them in scenarios of violence. Ironically, what the girl is being asked to focus on are the very things shes trying to avoid.|David famously had a (very) brief part as a drunken soldier in the 1969 film The Virgin Soldiers. The scene is in a dance hall where a fight breaks out, and may have inspired his line Sailors fighting in the dance hall https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzfrkmFigZs', '""Look at that cave man go!""""|This line is borrowed directly from the 1957 song Alley Oop, from the 60s pop group, The Hollywood Argyles.|As another cinematic figure, the caveman is traditionally a brute, a character of violence. This causes him to fit right in with the violence of the sailors and of the cop.', 'The darkest of these cinematic images is the policeman erroneously pulverizing an innocent man. Though this is first presented as just another one of the scenes that flickers across the screen, it actually calls back to the idea that art is reflective of the world. The film could be a simple action flick but it (whether intentionally or unintentionally) reflects the bleak reality of police brutality.|And speaking of lawmenthe cop drama, Life On Mars takes its title from this track.', 'Another surreal moment where Bowie blurs the line between whats real and whats fantasy. He muses about if the character being beat onscreen will ever realize hes really just a part of an act, a sort of cinematic circus that exploits his pain to draw in viewers.', 'The girls ultimate struggle is to escape the discouraging realities of Earth for the captivating fantasies of Mars. Thus, within the context of the song, Mars becomes the symbol for all escapist media: film, television, books, etc.|In this very simple line, Bowie provides us with a lot of layers. He lays down this contrast while still presenting the question for what it really is: a melancholy call for the hope that there is something beyond than what the mousy girl knows. To hope for life on Mars is to hope that the fantasies of film can be achieved in one way or another but its also asking the songs fundamental question: can there truly be an escape from reality?|Bowie clarifies,|""I think she finds herself disappointed with reality  that although shes living in the doldrums of reality, shes being told that theres a far greater life somewhere, and shes bitterly disappointed that she doesnt have access to it.""""', 'This verse is the most hard hitting satire. Mickey Mouse is one of Americas most innocuous icons. Bowie could be labelling him a cash cow, something that has become inherently commercial, but that phrase had only just been coined when Life On Mars? was written. Its more likely that he means Mickey is a sacred cow, held above criticism. Mickey has evolved from a much-loved cartoon to a potent symbol of Hollywood commercialism.', 'In reference of how in the late 60s, communism (which Vladimir Lenin, and counterculture in general were very much in style (Cause Lenins on sale again) and to John Lennons song Working Class Hero which had just come out. The pun connecting Lennon and Lenin highlights how communism (a rather anti-commercial ideology) became just as susceptible as Mickey Mouse in becoming something akin to a popular brand.', ""Package holidays became accessible to most British workers in the 60s and '70s. Taking at least one holiday a year was common even for the working class, particularly around school holidays, when people would migrate from their homes to tourist destinations like Ibiza and Norfolk.|Bowie is critiquing mass tourism: its hardly an escape if hordes of people travel to the same places together.|At the time, Ibiza was marketed as an beach destination with exotic Spanish food and culture, but in reality was a destination where British tourists outnumbered locals.|The Norfolk Broads are a network of mostly navigable rivers and lakes in the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Norfolk was a more traditional destination destination for tourism within Britain, particularly for working class Londoners, both for cottage holidays and for renting a boat to tour the waterways."", 'Rule, Britannia! is a British patriotic chant.|Its a bit meaningless to anyone outside the ruling class. Ordinary women, dogs, and circus clowns dont rule anything, disconnecting them from the songs nationalism.', 'The evident change in perspective switches from the young girl to this second character who speaks in the first person. Again, it could be interpreted as both Bowie and the filmmaker character as both are artists who create and are subject to become obsessed with a concept or finding the reflections in a concept.|The character concedes with the girl that the film is a saddening bore but recognizes it because hes written the same thing over and over. This is very similar to what Bowie says about songwriting in the annotation above,|""I think that really, my subject matter hasnt really changed over the years. That Im still In a way, Im still writing Life on Mars, still all these years laterIts like I want to keep writing about the same subject but my approach is like Im trying to get into it, like finding a different door each time I approach that same subject.""""', 'Despite flat out admitting that the media watched is a depressing bore rife with the realities that surround usBowie commands that its going to be written yet again.|The question was asked whether something could be fundamentally escapist, whether the girl (and anyone else) truly escape from realityand the answer seems to be No. The creator sees it as his duty to provide reflection on the world and sadly cannot provide simple escapism. He has to ask you to focus on this string of violent, anxiety ridden images because they are the problems that have to be faced.', 'As the song ends there are a few things of note to pay attention to|First off, the string arrangement. None other than legendary Bowie Guitarist Mick Ronson composed the string section for Life on Mars?. Bowie would later call it One of (Ronsons) first, and best string parts.|Secondly, when listening closely to the piano reprise you can hear the studios telephone ringing over the music.']",18

Fantine is reminiscing about the joy she had in her youth, preparing to contrast it with her life in poverty after having a child out of wedlock.', '""Poverty is mother to no man, Yet poverty is the sister of mankind, But no man on earth wants her/it for a child, Like a bastard born in a cell in the Bastille.""|In these four lines, we see a variety of familial metaphors used to describe poverty, trying to understand the relationship of humanity to this awful phenomenon. Either Fantine is speaking about poverty as a concept, or using it to refer to an impoverished woman to represent all les misrables.|Poverty does not nurture anyone (elle n\'est mre de personne), it only harms them. It does not do good things for them. It does not teach them or raise them up right in the world. We reject it (personne sur terre n\'en veut pour fille), aiming to minimize its influence and visibility in our lives, yet it is still a part of our world. The fact that poverty is still present (elle est pourtant soeur des hommes) brings up the question: if we all have this distaste and hatred for poverty, and agree that it robs human beings of their dignity, why is it still here? Are we doing enough to fight it?', '""Poverty gives birth to distress, Many vices, and all weakness""|Back to the familial metaphors. Though poverty is no ones mother, it gives birth to/is the source of all human weakness, vice, and pain. Fantine embodies this herself: suffering, with her power and options taken away from her, she falls to the level of a prostitute, succumbing to vice in order to save her child.', '""Poverty unleashes the beast in men And thus the msange becomes a stray dog.""|Une msange is a popular name referring to several types of birds, namely the tit and chickadee. The use of an avian metaphor in this context is highly reminiscent of a line from the original book Les misrables (the brick):| In the animal world, no creature born to be a dove turns into a scavenger. This happens only among men. |In its original context, this line referred to ponine (specifically, as she was flitting about Marius\' apartment, trying to express her natural curiosity, but with the restraint taught to her by years of abuse and poverty), but it is easily applicable to Fantine, as well. Indeed, the two women are musically linked in the musical adaptation: this piece of music has the same tune as a line in On My Own, *The world is full of happiness that I have never known. They both had unfortunate lives, had special ties to Cosette, and at the end were redeemed through their love (Fantine for Cosette; ponine for Marius).', '""We must feel ourselves survive In a child to whom we give life And in this source of innocence We must drown our despair To not put an end To this life without a future""|Fantine is saying here both that Cosette is her only reason for living and, more generally, that our children are how we live on after were gone. Though our lives may be hopeless, our childrens are not, not yet.|Cosette keeps Fantine from suicide, and Fantine will live on through her, after she has died. Valjeans debt to Fantine is paid to her daughter, and Cosettes love for her surrogate father expresses not only her love, but her\'mothers love and gratitude as well. By raising up Cosette well, he gives her the future that her mother couldnt have, but wanted for her child.']",5
